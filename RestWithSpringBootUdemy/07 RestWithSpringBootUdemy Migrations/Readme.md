### Flyway

Flyway brings the largest benefits when integrated within an application. By integrating Flyway you can ensure that the application and its database will always be compatible, with no manual intervention required. Flyway checks the version of the database and applies new migrations automatically before the rest of the application starts. This is important, because the database must first be migrated to a state the rest of the code can work with.
